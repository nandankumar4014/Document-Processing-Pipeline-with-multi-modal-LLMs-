üìÑ DocuHawk: Insurance Document Analyzer
DocuHawk is a Streamlit application designed to streamline the process of analyzing insurance PDF documents. It combines the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract, segment, and answer questions about document content, providing a quick and efficient way to find key information.

‚ú® Features
PDF Processing: Upload a PDF insurance document and automatically process it to extract text and images.

OCR Integration: Utilizes pytesseract to convert document pages into machine-readable text.

Advanced Text Extraction: Leverages the Groq vision model to accurately capture text from document pages, including structured data like tables.

Smart Metadata Extraction: Automatically identifies and extracts critical metadata such as policy number, policy holder name, and policy dates.

Document Segmentation: Uses an LLM to detect headers and subheaders, segmenting the document into logical sections for easier navigation.

Interactive Q&A: Ask natural language questions about the document's content and get concise, accurate answers.

Visual Highlighting: The application finds and highlights the exact location of the answer in the original document image, providing visual verification.

User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a clean, intuitive web interface.

üöÄ How to Run Locally
Prerequisites
You'll need a Groq API key to use the LLM features. You can get one for free from the Groq Console.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/docuhawk.git
cd docuhawk
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
